## List of some features that i decided not develop but are needed to complete the game

- [ ] Handle what to do when player leave in game (Depends on which step of the game we are)

- [ ] To check if all players answered:
  - Currently :x: : Checking if the number of answers for each actual round attempts are superior or equal to the number of players
  - Better way :white_check_mark: : Store the player id for each answer and all players still in the game need to have answered
